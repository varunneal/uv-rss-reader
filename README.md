An extremely simple RSS reader in python. Almost all auto-generated by claude. 
Built on top of [feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser). Run using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). 

Usage:

Clone this and run

```
uv run rss.py <feed_url>
```

At some point i'll add uvx tools so you don't have to clone.
